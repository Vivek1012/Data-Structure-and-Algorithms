1. 
To find the number is in power of 2 or not " int power_of_2 = n & (n-1); ".

2.
To find the number of bits in long number " int number_of_bits = Long.toBinaryString(n).length() - 1; ".

3. 
To find the number of set bits in integer or long " int number_of_1s = Long.bitCount(x); "


4.
In Java unsigned integers are not available, so to find the negation of unsigned integers
we should do it in this way, where x is the number whose negation is to be find : 
((long)Math.pow(2,32)-1)^x
